										<h3 class="major">My Math Journey</h3>
										<p>Unlike some folks, I did not originally plan on being a mathematician. Like all folks, my journey has been nonlinear. I've always loved math, but I also loved reading, analyzing, and writing about literature.</p>
										<p>Eventually I settled on both, though I was told by some professors in each department, without solicitation, that I was making a mistake. While it was a lot more work and certainly more taxing on my mental health (important factors to consider!), I graduated with my B.A. in English and my B.S. in math. Ironically, the more I've pursued math, the more I've had to rely on skills acquired through my liberal arts degree.</p>
										<p>Though I started my PhD in pure math in Denver, my husband got stationed at Ft. Bragg in North Carolina, so I transferred to NCSU after finishing up my MS. Up to that point, I had been mostly interested in computational algebra. At NC State, I knew (not consciously) that I shouldn't choose between two subjects about which I felt equally passionate, algebra and modeling. As I experienced at UT, there was a deep unconscious knowing to pursue what I loved and trust that "the right path forward" would emerge. Gratefully, one did. Like Glennon Doyle said, the braver I am, the luckier I seem to get.</p>
										<p>My PhD thesis considers the problem of mathematically modeling the chemical reactions that occur during hemostasis, the first stage of wound healing. We developed a model based on mass-action kinetics and have begun tackling many of the associated problems; I discuss all of this in detail in my research statement, so please peruse below if you want to learn more! Although modeling was brand-new to me, which was honestly pretty intimidating, I was drawn to it because it gave me flexibility to consider a wide range of mathematical approaches in a variety of applications. Currently, I am developing and implementing column subset selection algorithms for practical parameter identifiability analysis, which means that I get to use on my discrete algebraic skills for modeling questions! (By the way, we now have a semi-official title for this "right path" procedure I've described, aptly named for the computational algorithm we stole the idea from--"<a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rAGMJfioFvkcHFJFte5SHhBN44_nQF07/view?usp=sharing"> The Greedy Algorithm </a>!") </p>
