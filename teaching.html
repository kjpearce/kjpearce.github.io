										<h3 class="major">Teaching at UT Austin</h3>
<p> While at UT, I've taught M408Q (Calculus for Business), and I have also been an instructor with the Texas Prison Education Initiatve (TPEI). Through TPEI, the UT math department, and now the NSF, I've taught several iterations of M305G (Precalculus) and M341K (Discrete Math) at Lockhart Correctional Facility. You can read more about my prison education experience <a href="assets/Pearce_Notices.pdf">here</a>. I also developed my own course "The Art of Mathematics" that I've taught for two summers now at the prison that's become one of our most popular electives; you can find my course materials <a href="artmath.html">here</a>.
                                        </p>

                                        <h3 class="major">Teaching at NC State</h3>
										<p>  During my time at NC State, I was able to teach Calculus 2 and 3 as the instructor of record.
In evaluations from 73 out of 114 students in my Calculus 2 course, I received 4.8/5 in teaching effectiveness, 4.9/5 for enthusiasm about material, 4.9/5 for receptiveness outside of class, 4.9/5 for aligning my teaching with course outcome objectives, and 4.9/5 for consistently treating students with respect. </p>
                                            
     <p>                                       Then COVID-19 hit while I was teaching Calculus 3, which provided a challenging and unique learning opportunity for me as an instructor. To keep my teaching practices sharp, I completed over 60 hours of teaching certifications and trainings with a specific focus on rigorous <i> and </i> compassionate teaching. I want to help everyone see themselves as a "math person."</p>
