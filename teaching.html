										<h3 class="major">My Philosophy</h3>
										<p>I believe every person has an innate ability to appreciate mathematics. Whether or not we're aware of them, we're all impressed by beautiful symmetries in nature. We get joy and satisfaction out of discovering patterns, like in our favorite songs, games, or art. My teaching philosophy is fundamentally rooted in this belief. 
										<p>In my opinion, the biggest obstacle to positive learning outcomes is perception: both the student's and teacher's perceptions of the student as a learner, as well as each of their perceptions of the teacher as an educator. I believe it is my responsibility as an educator to positively influence and even change these perceptions in my classroom, by celebrating students' unique identities and strengths as well as sharing my own.</p>
										<p>For the first time in graduate school, I experienced the challenge of teaching lectures that resonated with every student equally in a large class. When student learning outcomes didn't align with our goals, I looked for underlying causes or personal biases reflected in the classroom that might be affecting student performance. For example, I noticed I was demonstrating a pattern of only calling on a few students in a large calculus lecture, so I wrote a simple code on my laptop that ``randomly'' generated student names from the roster. 
										To have correct pronunciations, I'd asked students to complete a survey for completion credit including phonetic spellings of their names. I also gave students time to "think-pair-share" with nearby classmates before calling on anyone. Those differences translated into higher student participation because I felt more empowered in my teaching, students felt more confident in their learning, and most importantly, students felt that I was invested in their success and invested themselves equally. My course evaluations reflected this phenomenon; with evaluation responses from 73 out of 114 students in MA 241, I received 4.8/5 in teaching effectiveness, 4.9/5 for enthusiasm about material, 4.9/5 for receptiveness outside of class, 4.9/5 for aligning my teaching with course outcome objectives, and 4.9/5 for consistently treating students with respect.</p>
