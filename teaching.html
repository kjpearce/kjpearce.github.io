										<h3 class="major">Teaching at UT Austin</h3>
<p> Since I began my postdoc fellowship, I have been a volunteer instructor of record with the Texas Prison Education Initiatve (TPEI). Through UTX, I have taught math courses at Lockhart Correctional Facility here in Texas. You can read more about my experience <a href="assets/Pearce_Notices.pdf">here</a>.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
Many of my students at Lockhart have had bad experiences with math and education in general, and yet they are some of the most diligent and hardworking students I've ever had. Maybe for a few unicorns, math is an innate skill, but I think for most of us, problem solving abilities come from experience.
                                            I think that's why  TPEI students who previously struggled in school are so successful in their UT courses: motivation. They know how to persevere despite setbacks. It's a privilege to be able to share my love of math with them and see them grow to love it too.
                                        </p>
                                    </section>

                                        <h3 class="major">Teaching at NC State</h3>
										<p>  During my time at NC State, I was able to teach Calculus 2 and 3 as the instructor of record.
In evaluations from 73 out of 114 students in my Calculus 2 course, I received 4.8/5 in teaching effectiveness, 4.9/5 for enthusiasm about material, 4.9/5 for receptiveness outside of class, 4.9/5 for aligning my teaching with course outcome objectives, and 4.9/5 for consistently treating students with respect. </p>
                                            
     <p>                                       COVID-19 hit during the semester I taught Calculus 3, which provided a challenging and unique learning opportunity for me as an instructor. To sharpen my teaching abilities, I completed over 60 hours of teaching certifications and trainings with a specific focus on inclusive STEM teaching. I'm passionate about helping everyone see themselves as a "math person."</p>
